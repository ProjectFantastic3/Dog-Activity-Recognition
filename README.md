# Dog Activity Tracker Project

This Dog Activity Tracker project is a collaborative effort by members m1, m2, and m3. The project aims to track and predict dog activities using sensor data from a Wit Motion sensor. The trained CNN model processes the sensor data to make predictions without relying on visual input.

## Sections
